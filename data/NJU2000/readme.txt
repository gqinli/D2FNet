NJUDS2000--A dataset designed for evaluation of depth-aware salient object detection methods.
This dataset includes more than 2000 stereo images, as well as depth maps and manually labeled ground truth.

--LR--
This folder includes the original color images. The left and right images are named with suffixes of "_left" and "_right" respectively. All the images have been rectified to meet the epipolar constraint.

--GT--
This folder contains the ground truth salient object masks of the left images. The masks are recorded in binary images, where "1" indicates object and "0" stands for background.

--depth--
This folder consists of the depth maps of the left images, which are generated by [1]. Each image is rescaled to [0,255], the larger intensity, the nearer pixel to observer. Please note that some of the depth maps could be inaccurate and thus may puzzle your method. One can also make use of the other stereo methods to get more accurate depth results.

Release Notes:

Version 1. 2014.10.23
2000 images. 400 of them are chosen as a trial dataset: NJUDS400.

Version 2. 2015.6.18
1985 images. 97 images with bad depth maps are removed. Then 100 new images are carefully chosen to add to the dataset. At last, the left and right color images of 18 personal photos are removed for the protection of individual privacy. However, the depth maps and ground truth masks are retained.
